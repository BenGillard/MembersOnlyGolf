# Scores over time

There are two courses at Thornbury, one full and one par 3. They are separated here. Scores over time are tracked to see if scores are improving (or not!).

#NOTE: when R converts dates to numerics (as it does when unlist() strips class), convert back using as.Date and use the origin "1970-01-01". Ohter programs may use different origins so there is no default in R. Because the conversion takes place in R in this example, class(x)<- "Date" will convert the numberic back to the proper date.

Breaking the magic *100* is a intimidating mountain to climb. **Doug managed it first at Thornbury on 20/09/21**. So far, since we joined on 31/07/2021, there have been a total of `r sum(fullscores$fullscoresFULL$Score < 100)` sub hundy rounds. Here is the roll of honour:

```{r subhundyrollofhonour}
fullscores$fullscoresFULL[which(fullscores$fullscoresFULL$Score < 100),] %>% kableExtra::kbl(caption = "Sub-Hundy Roll of Honour", align = "c", escape = FALSE, digits = 0, row.names = FALSE) %>%  kableExtra::kable_classic(full_width = T, html_font = "Cambria") %>%  row_spec(1:nrow(fullscores$fullscoresFULL[which(fullscores$fullscoresFULL$Score < 100),]), bold = T, background = "#c9b037")
```

# Number of rounds played.

We want to make sure we use our memberships to the absolute max so it's worth tracking how many rounds we've played.

```{r RoundsPlayed}
#+1 par3 round that we lost the scorecard for!

RoundSummary<- rbind(Full = sapply(unique(holescoresFULL$Player), function(x) holescoresFULL %>% filter(Player == x) %>% filter(!duplicated(Date)) %>% na.omit() %>% nrow(), USE.NAMES = T), Par3 = sapply(unique(holescoresPAR3$Player), function(x) holescoresPAR3 %>% filter(Player == x) %>% filter(!duplicated(Date)) %>% na.omit() %>% nrow(), USE.NAMES = T)+1, TotalHoles = sapply(unique(holescoresFULL$Player), function(x) holescoresFULL %>% filter(Player == x) %>% na.omit() %>% nrow(), USE.NAMES = T), MoneySaved = sapply(unique(holescoresFULL$Player), function(x) holescoresFULL %>% filter(Player == x) %>% na.omit() %>% nrow(), USE.NAMES = T)*(34/18) + sapply(unique(holescoresPAR3$Player), function(x) holescoresPAR3 %>% filter(Player == x) %>% na.omit() %>% nrow(), USE.NAMES = T)*(15/18))

```

**NOTE: The count for the full course includes rounds when 9 holes have been played as well as a full round. One Par3 scorecard was lost to the ether so the scores are not included but that round is still represented in the times played table.**

The formula used for working out how much our golf would have cost uses the full price of a round on the full course (£34) and the Par 3 course (£15) and therefore doesn't take into account discount rates at certain times.

$Cost of one hole = Full price / 18$

$Cost of one hole * number of holes played$

# Hole Probing

These box plots show how each player makes it through a round. The black dots are the actual scores and the boxes show the average (blue line through box) and upper/lower quartiles (top/bottom of the box) scores for each hole. From this you may be able to spot your **bogey** holes (pun intended) or your best scoring holes.

Some numbers to complement these plots:

```

Consistency is imperative to a good golf score. Holes that you consistently get the same score on are good markers. *However*, the consistency may be bad! The most consistent hole(s) for Ben is `r MostConsistent$Ben` where he averages `r  HoleStatsAdjScoreSummary[MostConsistent$Ben,3]` but the least consistent is `r LeastConsistent$Ben` where he averages `r  HoleStatsAdjScoreSummary[LeastConsistent$Ben,3]`. The most consistent hole(s) for Doug is `r MostConsistent$Doug` where he averages `r  HoleStatsAdjScoreSummary[MostConsistent$Doug,7]` but the least consistent is `r LeastConsistent$Doug` where he averages `r  HoleStatsAdjScoreSummary[LeastConsistent$Doug,7]`. The most consistent hole(s) for Lew is `r MostConsistent$Lew` where he averages `r  HoleStatsAdjScoreSummary[MostConsistent$Lew,11]` but the least consistent is `r LeastConsistent$Lew` where he averages `r  HoleStatsAdjScoreSummary[LeastConsistent$Lew,11]`.

> Here would be a good time to mention that the round played on the Par 3 course on 22nd September 2021 by the right honourable Douglas is an unverifiable round. Despite us all believing that he "got a hole in one" he did it when *noone else was around to see it*. The jury will, unfortunately, always be out on this one.

# Par performance

Some players may not be able to handle their wood but are deadly with an iron. To roughly gauge long vs short game, Par can be used to see how well our golfing warriors perform on different types of holes. Looking at overall performance on holes with different Par looks a little something like this:

```{r ParPerformance, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.show='hold', out.width='100%', results='hide'}
HolePar<- lapply(levels(as.factor(holescores$Par)), function(x) subset(holescores, subset = holescores$Par == x))
names(HolePar)<- c("Par 3", "Par 4", "Par 5")
lapply(names(HolePar), function(x) invisible(ggplot(data = HolePar[[x]], aes(x = Player, y = Adj_Score)) + geom_boxplot(col = "blue") + geom_jitter(col = "black", cex = 1, height = 0, width = 0.3) + 
                 scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(-2, 8, 1),minor_breaks = NULL, labels = c("eagle", "birdie", "par", "bogey", "double bogey", "triple bogey", "+4", "+5", "+6", "+7", "+8")) +
                 labs(title = paste0("Par Performance: ", x, " holes"), y = "Score") + theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "springgreen2"), legend.position = "none")))
```

...and as histograms:

```{r ParPerformanceHisto, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.show='hold', out.width='100%'}
ggplot(holescores, aes(x = Adj_Score, colour = Player, fill = Player)) + 
  geom_histogram(position = "dodge", alpha = 0.5, binwidth = 0.5) + 
  scale_x_continuous(labels = c("Eagle", "Birdie", "Par", "Bogey", "Double Bogey", "Triple Bogey", "+4", "+5", "+6", "+7"), breaks = seq(-2,7,1)) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = -90, hjust = -0.01, vjust = 0.2)) + labs(title = "Histogram of scores from all courses", x = NULL)
```

# Handicap Tracker

These three noble warriors will probably be scratch golfers in no time. So this graph is designed to document their rise to the pro game.

Handicap was calculated by taking the adjusted course score (max quadruple bogey per hole) over the last few rounds then dividing it by the number of rounds included. The official maximum handicap was 28 but it's been upped to 54 now! Par 3 courses have been excluded from the handicap calculations, as have any cheeky 9 hole rounds.

> This graph would probably be better with a rolling summary. i.e. for the last 5 rounds record handicap after rounds 1,2,3 then 2,3,4 then 3,4,5. It'll be a better measure of progress over time. Work backwards from the last round using lapply and a sequence. Hard to implement.

```{r HandicapTracker, echo=FALSE}
